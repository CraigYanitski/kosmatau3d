================

:code:`kosmatau3d` is the result of a couple of doctoral theses.
It owes its current form to rigourous testing and suggestion from several people.
Its core developers are Silke Andree-Labsch (for KOSMA-:math:`\tau` 3D) and Craig Yanitski (for :code:`kosmatau3d`).
Both were supervised by Volker Ossenkopf-Okada in the group C1 in SFB 956.
Further feedback and assistance were provided by Markus Rollig, Christoph Bruckmann, Yoko Okada, Aleena Baby, Slawa Kabanovic, Christof Buchbender, Ronan Higgins, Juan-Luis Verbena, Cristian Guevara, and Prachi Khatri.

Citing :code:`kosmatau3d`
-------------------------

Please cite the two primary papers describing the functionality of :code:`kosmatau3d`: Andree-Labsch et al. (2017) and Yanitski et al. (2022).
If use the single-voxel model to compare to the pixels in a map (the so-called `column` mode of :code:`kosmatau3d.models.Voxel()`), then please also cite Okada, Yanitski et al. (2022), which is the first description of this feature.
