    "It has been a fairly long time since I have sent you any plot or update, so I will show you some of the features I mentioned in the group meeting. The first aspect I want to show is that I am calculating the line-of-sight correctly. This can be seen in the plot below. I have run a large grid of sightlines to give this plot a high resolution. The size of each voxel is 1000 pc, so I will have to scale this to the sightline inside of the galactic disk."

    "I have gridded the intensities with `cygrid` using a Mollweide projection, but all of the features are overshadowed by the galactic center. Due to the FUV distribution, this is expected. I tried limiting the colorbar to show the other features, and the features in the galactic disk are less than 10 000 times smaller than that of the core. I will try to create a figure of the $C^+$ intensity like in Cubick et al. (2003), but I want to get rid of these blocky features. Perhaps scaling my line of sight to the size of the disk (which needs to be done anyway) will fix this, but I need to look into it further. There is also still some asymmetry in the north-south direction that is not present in the individual voxels."

    "To see the nature of what I had regridded in `cygrid`, I plot a flat map of the observed intensities along these sightlines. It does seem a bit redundant to have so many intensities at latitudes near $\\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, but it was necessary to conform to the `fits` standard. That being said, maybe I should not use the FITS standard for the synthetic integrated intensities. I am using it at the moment to support the ND-arrays produces by `KOSMA-$\\tau^3$`. It is clear that the large-scale blocky structures are an artefact of my code, and not an issue of resolution of the sightline integration. There is also some improvements I can make to determine whether a voxel is in the sightline."
