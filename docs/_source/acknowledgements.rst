:code:`kosmatau3d` is the result of two doctoral theses.
It owes its current form to rigourous testing and suggestions from several 
people.
Its core :doc:`developers <development>` were Silke Andree-Labsch (for 
KOSMA-:math:`\tau` 3D) and Craig Yanitski (for :code:`kosmatau3d`).
Both were advised by Priv. Doz. Dr. Volker Ossenkopf-Okada in the group C1 in 
`SFB 956 <https://www.sfb956.de>`_.
Aditi Sinha is now also developer focusing on the implementation of 
:code:`kosmatau3d` as a subgrid model for the SILCC (M)HD simulations.
She is advised by Priv. Doz. Dr. Volker Ossenkopf-Okada in the group A6 in 
`SFB 1601 <https://sfb1601.astro.uni-koeln.de>`_.

Further feedback and assistance were provided by Markus Rollig, Christoph 
Bruckmann, Yoko Okada, Aleena Baby, Slawa Kabanovic, Christof Buchbender, Ronan 
Higgins, Juan-Luis Verbena, Cristian Guevara, and Prachi Khatri.

If use the single-voxel model to compare to the pixels in a map (the so-called 
`column` mode of :class:`kosmatau3d.models.Voxel()`), then please also cite the 
first description of this feature:
