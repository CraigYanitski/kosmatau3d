Future Development
==================

As seen on the home page, this code is under active development.
There are many planned extensions/improvements, so we offer this page to 
describe them.

Cython
------

From the beginning it was known that compiling the code in cython would 
dramatically improve its efficiency.
The issue with this is that the code needed to be developed before we would 
understand the most-efficient implementation (you can blame Craig Yanitski for 
that).
Now that the code is mostly working, it should not be too much work to rewrite 
in cython.

GUI
---

This existed in the first iteration of KOSMA-:math:`\tau` 3D developed by 
Silke Andree-Labsch (see Andree-Labsch et al. 2017).
While it existed to give some order to the series of scripts that existed 
before implementing an object-orientated approach, it is still a good idea to 
implement this and give some order to the slew of properties offered by the
model.
