The documentation of a clumpy PDR model.
****************************************

:code:`kosmatau3d` is a clumpy photo-dissociation region (PDR) model built on 
the KOSMA-:math:`\tau` PDR model from the Universität zu Köln and Tel Aviv 
University.
It's functionality and use in modelling the Galactic cooling lines in the 
Milky Way are explained in 
`Yanitski (2023) <https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/71850/>`_.

`InterStellar Medium DataBase (ISMDB) <https://ismdb.obspm.fr/>`_ hosted at 
the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon when their API is completed.
