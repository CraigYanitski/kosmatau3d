## History files

The data required for the integrated intensity maps of the Milky Way are stored here, separated for different model parameters. The format for the directory is ``r{resolution}_n{number of voxels}`` for each model. So for a model with resolution 1000 pc containing 3015 voxels, the directory is ``r1000.0_n3015``.
